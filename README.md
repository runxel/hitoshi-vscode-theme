# Hitoshi

Hitoshi is a dark editor theme with a warm retro charme, originally made for [Sublime Text](https://github.com/runxel/hitoshi-sublimetext-theme).

This is the attempt to translate the ST theme into a usable VS Code theme.
However this is not so easy since VSC is still not a mature editor and lacks essential features for developers, like variables in themes and the possibility of [background styling](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/3429).
While both are "just" a major inconveniences, it's still hurts the dev process a lot.
**This is still a heavily work in progress theme!**

Some of the [demos](/demo) were taken from the [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) theme and then modified.

# Hitoshi

Hitoshi is a dark editor theme with a warm retro charme, originally made for [Sublime Text](https://github.com/runxel/hitoshi-sublimetext-theme).

---

This is the attempt to translate the ST theme into a usable VS Code theme.
However this is not so easy since VSC is still not a mature editor and lacks essential features for developers, like variables in themes and the possibility of [background styling](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/3429).
While the first is "just" a major inconvenience, the latter is quite necessary for having a well working theme.
So for the moment I've stopped any efforts on this project :(
